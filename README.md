# javascript-flocking
I have, for a good length of time, wanted to do some motion stuies on flocking and group behaviors. After spending
the week at JSConf 2015, I finally took the time to set up a simple structure to let me add in different studies.
This repo is intended to be a place to share some of those experiments.

## Getting Started
The only prerequisite to using this repo locally is that you have [SASS installed](http://sass-lang.com/install).
Otherwise, the following should get you up and running:

```bash
$ npm install gulp -g
$ npm install && gulp dev
```

Once that is running, the watchers are in place, and you can load the `dist/index.html` into your browser to play
with the experiments.
